# Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)
Backgroud: Solving diffrential equations is at the centre of many engineering problems
1. Solves differential equations
2. Neural network with unsupervised learning
3. Uses the knowledge of underlying physic
4. Exploits auto-differentiation technique to calcuate loss of the neural network model
